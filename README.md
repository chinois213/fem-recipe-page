## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
-CSS for styling
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I Learned how to use the CSS custom properties which makes it possible for me to easily reuse certain properties of my design.In the code snippet, i created custom properties for different colors of the design, and also created some custom properties for font-size im my design

```css
:root{
  
    --fs-base:16px;
    --fs-1:32px;
    --fs-2:28px;
    --fs-3:19px;
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --stone100:hsl(30, 54%, 90%);
    --stone150: hsl(30, 18%, 87%);
    --stone600: hsl(30, 10%, 34%);
    --stone900: hsl(24, 5%, 18%);
    --brown800:hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
    --rose800:hsl(332, 51%, 32%);
    --rose50:hsl(330, 100%, 98%);

    --sm:375px;
    --lg:720px;
    --xl:1440px ;

}
```
I also learned how to use HTML semantic tacks in my HTML structure , as seen below with the main and section tags

```html
   <main>
     <section></section>
   </main>
```

### Continued development

I need to understand more about the use of media Queries in CSS.

### Useful resources

- [W3Shools](https://www.W3Shools.com) - This website assisted in implementing font import using the @font-face css asset.
